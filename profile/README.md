## 🛠️ **Git Collaboration Guide for ERP Corner**  
This document is designed to streamline collaboration for the ERP Corner development team, ensuring efficient Git practices for optimal project management.

### 🔀 **Branching Strategy**  
At ERP Corner, we use a structured Git branching system to maintain code quality and enable seamless teamwork.

- **Main Branch**  
  Holds the production-ready version of the application. Changes here are tested and approved for end-users.  

- **Dev Branch**  
  A staging area where features are tested by the team. It’s one step before reaching the main branch.

- **Dev Authors Branch**  
  Used by individual developers or teams working on specific features. This branch is where active development occurs.

  - `fix`: Bug fixes or corrections.
  
- **Module**: The module affected by the changes (e.g., `sales`, `warehouse`, `master`).

- **Description**: A brief summary of the change made.
